	the filenames.
  * New feature: H2 self-shielding of Lyman-Werner radiation using the
	Wolcott-Green et al. (2011) model. Length scales for H2 column
	density can be calculated using 1) neighboring grid zones (grid
	codes only), 2) a user-supplied array of lengths, or 3) the local
	Jeans length.

	Pygrackle works with Python 3.4 and later. Python 2.7 is still
	supported.

	H2II + p) rate.

	UVbackground_redshift_fullon, UVbackground_redshift_drop, and
	UVbackground_redshift_on, to be user-settable and make
	redshift-dependent ramping factor symmetric in redshift.

	reactions for collisional ionization of H by H and H by He.
  * Enhancement: Refactored and improved pygrackle interface.

	greater simplicity
  * Enhancement: Internal chemistry and cooling calculation now always
	done in double precision with gr_float type only used for baryon

	with a custom variable type for better stability
