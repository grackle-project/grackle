Citing Grackle
--------------

The Grackle library was born out of the chemistry and cooling routines of the 
`Enzo <http://enzo-project.org/>`__ simulation code.  As such, all of those who 
have contributed to Enzo development, and especially to the chemistry and 
cooling, have contributed to the Grackle.

If you used the Grackle library in your work, please cite it as "the Grackle chemistry and cooling library (`Smith et al. 2017 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.466.2217S>`__)"
