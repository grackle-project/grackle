Welcome to the grackle chemistry and cooling library for astrophysical 
simulations!

The grackle documentation is available online here: grackle.readthedocs.org

The documentation can also be built locally.  See the README in the doc for 
more information.

The documentation explains how to build the library, integrate it into your 
code, configure it properly, and run some examples.
