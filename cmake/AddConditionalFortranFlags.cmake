# flags to a given target (that are compiler-specific).
# -> this is "conditional" in the sense that generator-expressions are used to
#    ensure that the flags are only applied to Fortran files
#
# the compiler will also provide some basic warnings about potential
# compiler-specific issues

# warning messages
