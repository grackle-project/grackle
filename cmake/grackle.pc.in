# This file may be generated with or without Requires.private (it should be
# configured so that it works properly in either case)
#  - unfortunately, when we use Requires.private, it ends up introducing extra
#    flags when compiling a shared library (and unnecessary Cflags when
#    compiling a static library)... It's probably ok, just ugly
