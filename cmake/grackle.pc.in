# DESCRIPTION
# -----------
#
# This file can be used with pkg-config or pkgconf to help link against grackle
#
# There are essentially 2 versions of this file:
#   1. The first version is intended for any installation that provides Grackle
#      as a shared library (including installations that provide it as both a
#      shared and a static library).
#   2. The second version is intended for inclusion in an installation that
#      that ONLY provides Grackle as a static library.
#
# Most projects ONLY provide a version of the first kind.
# 
# We provide both versions so that the build-system of a downstream
# application can directly use
#   - the compiler flags returned by ``pkg-config --cflags grackle``
#   - the linker flags returned by ``pkg-config --libs grackle``
# to consume Grackle without worrying about how exactly Grackle was installed
# (the caller may need to specify PKG_CONFIG_PATH)
#
# When the first version of this file is consumed provided in an installation
# that provides Grackle as both a shared and static library, you can access
# static-library-specific by invoking pkg-config with the ``--static`` flag. As
# discussed in the Grackle documentation, there are some challenges with
# static-linking in that particular scenario.


# The ${pcfiledir} variable is a feature of pkg-config & pkgconf that is
# commonly used to make the build relocatable (there's not a ton of docs on it)

# This file may be generated with or without Requires.private (it should be
# configured so that it works properly in either case)
#  - unfortunately, when we use Requires.private, it ends up introducing extra
#    flags when compiling a shared library (and unnecessary Cflags when
#    compiling a static library)... It's probably ok, just ugly
