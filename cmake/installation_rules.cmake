# Specify Installation Rules
# ==========================

# Before we go further, we are at a cross-roads of the various scenarios we
# can assume during installation.
#
# -> These assumptions mostly come up in the context of the "linker flags"
#    a downstream application needs to specify in order to properly link against
#    each of Grackle's implicit/explicit runtime dependencies (i.e. shared
#    libraries) when using Grackle as a static library (e.g. libgrackle.a)
#
# -> We report these linker-flags to downstream applications (in one form or
#    another) in special metadata files like pkg-config's .pc files or cmake's
#    Package-Config files
#
# -> aside: when a downstream application uses Grackle as a shared library
#    (e.g. libgrackle.so), they DON'T need to specify "linker flags" for
#    Grackle's runtime dependencies
#
# For the sake of the conversation, let's imagine that the we are using `ld`
# for linking together object files and the minimal set of "linker flags" for
# Grackle's dependencies are: `-lhdf5 -lm -lgfortran`
#
# We can now consider the 3 main scenarios:
#
# 1. The simplest case: there's 1 version of each of grackle's runtime
#    dependencies (or there are no potential version incompatabilites) AND they
#    are all installed in the standard-system-locations.
#
#    - In this case, we can use `-lhdf5 -lm -lgfortran` as flags. `ld` will be
#      able to find each library at compile time, and the operating system's
#      "dynamic linker" will be able to locate each dependency at runtime
#
#    - this scenario applies to most "vanilla" unixy systems that used a
#      package manager to install the dependencies
#
# 2. In this case, we can imagine that there are multiple incompatible versions
#    of (one or more) of Grackle's runtime library dependencies and that all of
#    the versions the runtime dependencies are in standard-system-locations.
#
#    - In this case, we can use `-L` flag(s) to specify paths that encourage
#      `ld` to identify the correct versions of the runtime dependencies while
#      assembling the downstream application and will encode the correct
#      version info into the resulting binary. The operating system's "dynamic
#      linker" will then identify the correct dependency at runtime.
#
#    - We are assuming that the paths remain valid between compiling grackle
#      and compiling the downstream application.
#
#    - Alternatively, we try the `-l` flag to specify something like
#      `-l:libhdf5.so.100` to force more precise linking... (but that may not
#      be a general solution)
#
# 3. In this case, we can imagine that one or more of Grackle's runtime library
#    dependencies is found in a non-standard location.
#
#    - a solution is to specify rpaths in linker flags. We would also need to
#      modify the shared library slightly in this scenario...
#
#    - we assume that the locations of the runtime-dependencies will always be
#      unchanged whenever we try to execute the program (if anything dependency
#      ever gets moved, the downstream application will stop working). Issues
#      could also arise if a downstream application depends on a
#      backwards-compatible, newer-version of grackle's dependencies.
#
#    - there is also some ambiguity here about determining which libraries
#      to introduce rpaths for... If a dependency can currently be found by the
#      operating system's "dynamic linker", but that's only because of the
#      values currently stored in an env variable (like LD_LIBRARY_PATH), what
#      do we do? This comes up when using intel-compilers provided through
#      intel-oneAPI
#
#    - a better solution to this scenario might be to encourage people to
#      directly link against stuff in the build directory. CMake already deals
#      with these linking issues for us (in there)
#
#
# It would be nice to support all 3 case but that's complicated. The first case
# is the simplest (and most-standard case). For now, we will ONLY support that
# case. But maybe we can introduce a user-flag to support the other cases.
#
# Alternatively, the final case seems like it might be addressed if people
# simply link to stuff in the build-directory. If we reorganize the results of
# a build so that they have the same install-directory







# important note: cmake uses the term `COMPONENT` to mean different things
#
# - there are "installation components":
#   - corresponds to COMPONENT kwarg(s) appearing in cmake's `install` command
#   - these "components" are for people like a Debian packager who might use
#     them to direct cmake to "install" only subsets of files to locations that
#     would become hypothetical packages called `libgrackle` (which just
#     contains the shared library) & `libgrackle-dev` (which includes the files
#     needed to compile a program using grackle)
#   - everybody else can ignore these COMPONENTS (by default, cmake installs
#     as much as it can -- plus they have no impact on what is built)
# - there are "import components"
#   - corresponds to the `COMPONENTS` and `OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS` kwargs
#     appearing in a downstream project's `find_package` invocation
#   - these can be used to indicate that only a subset of functionality from a
#     modularized-large-project dependency are needed
#   - our plan is to do something similar to hdf5 (they use them to specify a
#     requirement on a shared or static version of a library)
#   - these `COMPONENTS` are defined within the "Config Package File" that gets
#     installed by the rule defined by invoking `install(EXPORT ...)`

# for finding implicit Fortran dependencies
# -> this probably isn't adequate on systems where hdf5.pc can't be found
# -> it may not be adequate on some systems when using OpenMP
#
# Our current solution currently has some warts:
# -> On most systems these flags only tell the linker where to search for the 
#    libraries at link-time (they generally don't impact the runtime search).
#    They also say to use the libraries shipped with a compiler at link time
#    -> we effectively assume that libraries are found at run-time in normal
#       system installation paths. Thus, if a downstream is linked against a
#       static grackle library it will hopefully keep working even if we
#       replace our system's Fortran compiler
#    -> it kinda makes sense to use libraries shipped with the Fortran compiler
#       for linking. If there are multiple versions of the Fortran runtime, this
#       ensures that the downstream application knows to use the runtime that
#       is compatible with the original compiler (not sure if this is really
#       an issue in-practice...). At the same time, our pkg-config file will
#       break if we ever replace/upgrade the compiler...
#    -> a compromise: link against an ABI compatible version of the runtime. If
#       we know the library exists in a standard search-path at compile-time,
#       use that instead...
# -> We also aren't very consistent. It turns out on macOS, the linker uses the
#    link-time locations at runtime as well. This is equivalent to us also
#    specifying -rpath with absolute-paths on most systems.
#    -> it turns out that this works to our advantage right now because
#       libgfortran isn't at a system install-path... it is only attached to
#       the version of libgfortran shipped with the compiler
#    -> this does mean that an installation could break if you remove/replace
#       your fortran compiler. We could potentially reduce the chance of
#       breakage during gfortran upgrades by replacing the -L path to make use
#       of the symlink at /opt/homebrew/lib/gcc/...
