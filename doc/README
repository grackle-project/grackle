Grackle Documentation README

This documentation is available online at: grackle.readthedocs.io

In this directory and below are the Grackle documentation. They are written
using the ReST [1] formatting, which is parsed into final formats using the
Sphinx formatting engine [2].

Here are some benefits of using ReST + Sphinx:

- ReST is very readable in its raw form. It has minimal mark-up
  and is in plain text.
- Now that the documents are included in the Grackle mecurial repository,
  wherever you are (Plane, Train, Automobile), all the documents are there
  without needing access to the internet.
- Sphinx can parse the documents into many convenient formats, most notably HTML
  and a PDF.

Building the documentation requires Sphinx.  The easiest thing to do is to 
install the yt simulation analysis toolkit, available at yt-project.org.  
With that, simply type:

    pip install sphinx

With Sphinx installed, build the documentation by typing the following in the 
doc directory:

    make html

This will build html documentation in the build/html directory which is 
viewable with a web browser.
