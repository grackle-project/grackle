Parameters and Data Files
=========================

Parameters
----------

See :ref:`adding-new-params` for guidelines for adding new parameters.

For all on/off integer flags, 0 is off and 1 is on.

.. c:var:: int use_grackle

   Flag to activate the grackle machinery.  Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int with_radiative_cooling

   Flag to include radiative cooling and actually update the thermal
   energy during the chemistry solver.  If off, the chemistry species
   will still be updated.  The most common reason to set this to off
   is to iterate the chemistry network to an equilibrium state.
   Default: 1.

.. c:var:: int primordial_chemistry

   Flag to control which primordial chemistry network is used.
   Default: 0.

    - 0: no chemistry network.  Radiative cooling for primordial
      species is solved by interpolating from lookup tables
      calculated with Cloudy.
    - 1: 6-species atomic H and He.  Active species: H, H\ :sup:`+`,
      He, He\ :sup:`+`, \ :sup:`++`, e\ :sup:`-`.
    - 2: 9-species network including atomic species above and species
      for molecular hydrogen formation.  This network includes
      formation from the H\ :sup:`-` and H\ :sub:`2`\ :sup:`+`
      channels, three-body formation (H+H+H and H+H+H\ :sub:`2`),
      H\ :sub:`2` rotational transitions, chemical heating, and
      collision-induced emission (optional).  Active species: above +
      H\ :sup:`-`, H\ :sub:`2`, H\ :sub:`2`\ :sup:`+`.
    - 3: 12-species network include all above plus HD rotation cooling.
      Active species: above + D, D\ :sup:`+`, HD.

.. note:: In order to make use of the non-equilibrium chemistry
   network (:c:data:`primordial_chemistry` options 1-3), you must add
   and advect baryon fields for each of the species used by that
   particular option.

.. c:var:: int dust_chemistry

   Flag to control additional dust cooling and chemistry processes.
   Default: 0.

   - 0: no dust-related processes included.
   - 1: adds the following processes:

        #. photo-electric heating (sets :c:data:`photoelectric_heating` to 2).
        #. cooling from electron recombination onto dust (equation 9 from
           `Wolfire et al. 1995
           <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...443..152W/abstract>`__).
           Both the photo-electric heating and recombination cooling are scaled
           by the value of the :c:data:`interstellar_radiation_field`.
        #. H\ :sub:`2`\  formation on dust (sets :c:data:`h2_on_dust` to 1
           if :c:data:`primordial_chemistry` > 1).

        Setting :c:data:`dust_chemistry` greater than 0 requires
        :c:data:`metal_cooling` to be enabled.

.. note:: Other values for :c:data:`photoelectric_heating` may also be used
   in conjunction with setting the :c:data:`dust_chemistry` parameter. It will
   only be changed to 2 if unset.

.. c:var:: int h2_on_dust

   Flag to enable H\ :sub:`2` formation on dust grains, dust cooling, and
   dust-gas heat transfer follow `Omukai (2000)
   <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...534..809O>`_.  This assumes
   that the dust to gas ratio scales with the metallicity.  Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int metal_cooling

   Flag to enable metal cooling using the Cloudy tables.  If enabled, the
   cooling table to be used must be specified with the
   :c:data:`grackle_data_file` parameter.  Default: 0.

.. note:: In order to use the metal cooling, you must add and advect a
   metal density field.

.. c:var:: int cmb_temperature_floor

   Flag to enable an effective CMB temperature floor.  This is implemented
   by subtracting the value of the cooling rate at T\ :sub:`CMB` from the
   total cooling rate.  Default: 1.

.. c:var:: int UVbackground

   Flag to enable a UV background.  If enabled, the cooling table to be
   used must be specified with the :c:data:`grackle_data_file` parameter.
   Default: 0.

.. c:var:: float UVbackground_redshift_on

   Used in combination with :c:data:`UVbackground_redshift_fullon`,
   :c:data:`UVbackground_redshift_drop`, and
   :c:data:`UVbackground_redshift_off` to set an attenuation factor for the
   photo-heating and photo-ionization rates of the UV background model.
   See the figure below for an illustration its behavior.  If not set,
   this parameter will be set to the highest redshift of the UV background
   data being used.

.. c:var:: float UVbackground_redshift_fullon

   Used in combination with :c:data:`UVbackground_redshift_on`,
   :c:data:`UVbackground_redshift_drop`, and
   :c:data:`UVbackground_redshift_off` to set an attenuation factor for the
   photo-heating and photo-ionization rates of the UV background model.
   See the figure below for an illustration its behavior.  If not set,
   this parameter will be set to the highest redshift of the UV background
   data being used.

.. c:var:: float UVbackground_redshift_drop

   Used in combination with :c:data:`UVbackground_redshift_on`,
   :c:data:`UVbackground_redshift_fullon`, and
   :c:data:`UVbackground_redshift_off` to set an attenuation factor for the
   photo-heating and photo-ionization rates of the UV background model.
   See the figure below for an illustration its behavior.  If not set,
   this parameter will be set to the lowest redshift of the UV background
   data being used.

.. c:var:: float UVbackground_redshift_off

   Used in combination with :c:data:`UVbackground_redshift_on`,
   :c:data:`UVbackground_redshift_fullon`, and
   :c:data:`UVbackground_redshift_drop` to set an attenuation factor for the
   photo-heating and photo-ionization rates of the UV background model.
   See the figure below for an illustration its behavior.  If not set,
   this parameter will be set to the lowest redshift of the UV background
   data being used.

.. image:: _images/ramp.png

.. c:var:: char* grackle_data_file

   Path to the data file containing the metal cooling and UV background
   tables.  Default: "".

.. c:var:: float Gamma

   The ratio of specific heats for an ideal gas.  A direct calculation
   for the molecular component is used if :c:data:`primordial_chemistry`
   > 1.  Default:  5/3.

.. c:var:: int three_body_rate

   Flag to control which three-body H\ :sub:`2` formation rate is used.

    - 0: `Abel, Bryan & Norman (2002)
      <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002Sci...295...93A>`_

    - 1: `Palla, Salpeter & Stahler (1983)
      <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983ApJ...271..632P>`_

    - 2: `Cohen & Westberg (1983)
      <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983JPCRD..12..531C>`_

    - 3: `Flower & Harris (2007)
      <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.377..705F>`_

    - 4: `Glover (2008)
      <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AIPC..990...25G>`_

    - 5: `Forrey (2013)
      <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...773L..25F>`_.

   The first five options are discussed in `Turk et. al. (2011)
   <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...726...55T>`_.  Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int cie_cooling

   Flag to enable H\ :sub:`2` collision-induced emission cooling from
   `Ripamonti & Abel (2004)
   <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004MNRAS.348.1019R>`_.  Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int h2_optical_depth_approximation

   Flag to enable H\ :sub:`2` cooling attenuation from `Ripamonti &
   Abel (2004) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004MNRAS.348.1019R>`_.
   Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int photoelectric_heating

   Flag to enable photo-electric heating from irradiated dust grains.
   Default: 0.

    - 0: no photo-electric heating.
    - 1: a spatially uniform heating term from `Tasker & Bryan (2008)
      <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...673..810T>`__. The exact
      heating rate used must be specified with the
      :c:data:`photoelectric_heating_rate` parameter. For temperatures
      above 20,000 K, the photo-electric heating rate is set to 0.
    - 2: similar to option 1, except the heating rate is calculated
      using equation 1 of `Wolfire et al. (1995)
      <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...443..152W/abstract>`__
      and the user must supply the intensity of the interstellar radiation
      field with the :c:data:`interstellar_radiation_field` parameter. The
      value of epsilon is taken as a constant equal to 0.05 for gas below
      20,000 K and 0 otherwise.
    - 3: similar to option 1, except the value of epsilon is calculated
      directly from equation 2 of `Wolfire et al. (1995)
      <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...443..152W/abstract>`__.

.. c:var:: int dust_recombination_cooling

   Flag to enable recombination cooling onto dust grains using 
   equation 9 of `Wolfire et al. (1995) 
   <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...443..152W/abstract>`__
   rescaled by the local dust-to-gas ratio. This option is automatically 
   set by :c:data:`h2_on_dust` > 0 or :c:data:`dust_chemistry` > 0.
   Default: 0.

.. note:: With :c:data:`primordial_chemistry` > 0, the electron density
   used to calculate epsilon for :c:data:`photoelectric_heating` = 3
   only considers the contribution from primordial species, ignoring that
   of metals and dust grains, and so is most likely underestimated at low
   temperatures. In practice, epsilon is reasonably approximated as a
   constant of 0.05 in this regime.

.. c:var:: int photoelectric_heating_rate

   If :c:data:`photoelectric_heating` is enabled, the heating rate in
   units of (erg cm\ :sup:`-3` s\ :sup:`-1`) n\ :sup:`-1`\, where n is
   the total hydrogen number density. In other words, this is the
   volumetric heating rate at a hydrogen number density of 
   n = 1 cm\ :sup:`-3`\. Default: 8.5e-26.

.. c:var:: int use_isrf_field

   Flag to provide the strength of the interstellar radiation field
   as a field array using the :c:data:`isrf_habing` pointer. If set
   to 0, then the interstellar radiation field strength will be a
   constant set by :c:data:`interstellar_radiation_field`.

.. c:var:: float interstellar_radiation_field

   The strength of the interstellar radiation field in `Habing
   <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1968BAN....19..421H/abstract>`__
   units. A value of 1 corresponds to a mean intensity of 1.6x10\ :sup:`-3`
   erg s\ :sup:`-1` cm\ :sup:`-2`. This value is used to compute the
   dust photo-electric heating (if :c:data:`photoelectric_heating` > 1),
   recombination cooling (if :c:data:`dust_chemistry` > 0), and heating of
   the dust grains for the calculation of the dust temperature.
   Default: 1.7.

.. c:var:: int CaseBRecombination

   Flag to use the Case B recombination rates (and associated cooling
   rates) for H\ :sup:`+`, He\ :sup:`+`, and He\ :sup:`++` instead of
   the Case A rates. Set to 1 for Case B and 0 for Case A. The Case A
   rates include recombinations directly to the ground state (which
   would result in emission of an ionizing photon) as well as
   recombinations to excited states (which eventually reach the ground
   state through lower energy transitions). The Case B rates exclude
   recombinations directly to the ground state under the assumption
   that the ionizing photon is reabsorbed. Hence, the Case B rates are
   slightly lower than the Case A rates.
   Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int Compton_xray_heating

   Flag to enable Compton heating from an X-ray background following
   `Madau & Efstathiou (1999)
   <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJ...517L...9M>`_.  Default: 0.

.. c:var:: float LWbackground_intensity

   Intensity of a constant Lyman-Werner H\ :sub:`2` photo-dissociating
   radiation field in units of 10\ :sup:`-21` erg s\ :sup:`-1` cm\
   :sup:`-2` Hz\ :sup:`-1` sr\ :sup:`-1`.  Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int LWbackground_sawtooth_suppression

   Flag to enable suppression of Lyman-Werner flux due to Lyman-series
   absorption (giving a sawtooth pattern), taken from `Haiman & Abel,
   & Rees (2000) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...534...11H>`_.
   Default: 0.

.. c:var:: float HydrogenFractionByMass

   The fraction by mass of Hydrogen in the metal-free portion of the
   gas (i.e., just the H and He). In the non-equilibrium solver, this is
   used to ensure consistency in the densities of the individual species.
   In tabulated mode, this is used to calculate the H number density from
   the total gas density, which is a parameter of the heating/cooling tables.
   When using the non-equilibrium solver, a sensible default is 0.76.
   However, the tables for tabulated mode were created assuming
   n\ :sub:`He`/n\ :sub:`H` = 0.1, which corresponds to an H mass fraction of
   about 0.716.

   The default value stored in this variable is a negative value that denotes the value is unset.
   If the user doesn't modify the value, the value is overwritten with a value of about 0.716 in tabulated mode and a value of 0.76 in non-equilibrium mode.
   While users are allowed to set arbitrary values for the non-equilibrium solver, tabulated mode reports an error if the user initializes this to a value that does not exactly match the default.

.. c:var:: float DeuteriumToHydrogenRatio

   The ratio by mass of Deuterium to Hydrogen. Default: 6.8e-5 (the value
   from `Burles & Tytler (1998)
   <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...507..732B/abstract>`_
   multiplied by 2 for the mass of Deuterium).

.. c:var:: float SolarMetalFractionByMass

   The fraction of total gas mass in metals for a solar composition.
   Default: 0.01295 (consistent with the default abundances in the Cloudy code).

.. c:var:: float local_dust_to_gas_ratio

   The ratio of total dust mass to gas mass in the local Universe.
   Default: 0.009387 (from `Pollack et al. 1994
   <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994ApJ...421..615P/abstract>`_).

.. c:var:: int use_dust_density_field

   Flag to provide the dust density as a field using the :c:data:`dust_density`
   pointer in the :c:type:`grackle_field_data` struct. If set to 0, the dust
   density takes the value of :c:data:`local_dust_to_gas_ratio` multiplied
   by the metallicity. Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int use_volumetric_heating_rate

   Flag to signal that an array of volumetric heating rates is being
   provided in the :c:data:`volumetric_heating_rate` field of the
   :c:data:`grackle_field_data` struct.  Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int use_specific_heating_rate

   Flag to signal that an array of specific heating rates is being
   provided in the :c:data:`specific_heating_rate` field of the
   :c:data:`grackle_field_data` struct.  Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int use_temperature_floor

   Flag to enable the use of either a scalar value or field array providing
   a temperature floor. When set to 1, a single temperature floor
   value should then be set using
   :c:data:`temperature_floor_scalar`. When set to 2, temperature
   floor values for each computational element should be set with the
   :c:data:`temperature_floor` array pointer. When enabled, no
   chemistry or cooling calculations will be performed on an element
   with a temperature at or below the specified value. Default: 0.

.. c:var:: double temperature_floor_scalar

   The value of the temperature floor to use for all computational
   elements. This is used when :c:data:`use_temperature_floor` is set
   to 1.

.. c:var:: int use_radiative_transfer

   Flag to signal that arrays of ionization and heating rates from
   radiative transfer solutions are being provided. Only
   available if :c:data:`primordial_chemistry` is greater than 0. HI, HeI,
   and HeII ionization arrays are provided in :c:data:`RT_HI_ionization_rate`,
   :c:data:`RT_HeI_ionization_rate`, and :c:data:`RT_HeII_ionization_rate`
   fields, respectively, of the :c:data:`grackle_field_data` struct.
   Associated heating rate is provided in the :c:data:`RT_heating_rate`
   field, and H\ :sub:`2`\ photodissociation rate can also be provided in the
   :c:data:`RT_H2_dissociation_rate` field when
   :c:data:`primordial_chemistry` is set to either 2 or 3. Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int radiative_transfer_coupled_rate_solver

   When used with :c:data:`use_radiative_transfer` set to 1, this flag
   makes it possible to solve the chemistry and cooling of the
   computational elements for which the radiation field is non-zero
   separately from those with no incident radiation. This allows radiation
   transfer calculations to be performed on a smaller timestep than the
   global timestep. The parameter,
   :c:data:`radiative_transfer_intermediate_step`, is then used to toggle
   between updating the cells/particles receiving radiative input and those
   that are not. Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int radiative_transfer_intermediate_step

   Used in conjunction with :c:data:`radiative_transfer_coupled_rate_solver`
   set to 1, setting this parameter to 1 tells the solver to only update
   cells/particles where the radiation field is non-zero. Setting this
   to 0 updates only those elements with no incident radiation. When
   :c:data:`radiative_transfer_coupled_rate_solver` is set to 0, changing
   this parameter will have no effect. Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int radiative_transfer_hydrogen_only

   Flag to only use hydrogen ionization and heating rates from the 
   radiative transfer solutions. Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int H2_self_shielding

   Switch to enable approximate H\ :sub:`2`\  self-shielding from both the UV
   background dissociation rate and the H\ :sub:`2`\  dissociation rate
   given by :c:data:`RT_H2_dissociation_rate` (if present).  Three options
   exist for the length scale used in calculating the H\ :sub:`2`\  column
   density. Default: 0.

    - 1: Use a Sobolev-like, spherically averaged method from
      `Wolcott-Green \& Haiman (2019)
      <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.484.2467W/>`__. Prior to
      Grackle version 3.2, this option used the method of `Wolcott-Green et. al.
      (2011) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.418..838W/>`__.
      This option is only valid for Cartesian grid codes in 3D.
    - 2: Supply an array of lengths using the :c:data:`H2_self_shielding_length`
      field.
    - 3: Use the local Jeans length.

.. c:var:: int H2_custom_shielding

   Flag to enable the user to provide an additional field which acts as 
   an additional attenuation factor for both the UV background dissociation 
   rate and the H\ :sub:`2`\  dissociation rate given by 
   :c:data:`RT_H2_dissociation_rate` (if present), that is separate from the 
   :c:data:`H2_self_shielding` attenuation factor. 
   The factor, which is intended to be unspecific can e.g. be used in order 
   to include grain size dependent dust extinction or any other user-specific 
   source of attenuation.
   Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int self_shielding_method

   Switch to enable approximate self-shielding from the UV background.
   All three of the below methods incorporate Eq. 13 and 14 from 
   `Rahmati et. al. 2013 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.430.2427R>`_.
   These equations involve using the spectrum averaged photoabsorption cross
   for the given species (HI or HeI). These redshift dependent values are
   pre-computed for the HM2012 and FG2011 UV backgrounds and included in
   their respective cooling data tables. Default: 0

   Care is advised in using any of these methods. The default behavior is to
   apply no self-shielding, but this is not necessarily the proper assumption,
   depending on the use case. If the user desires to turn on self-shielding,
   we strongly advise using option 3. All options include HI self-shielding, and
   vary only in treatment of HeI and HeII. In options 2 and 3, we approximately
   account for HeI self-shielding by applying the Rahmati et. al. 2013 relations,
   which are only strictly valid for HI, to HeI under the assumption that it behaves 
   similarly to HI. None of these options are completely correct in practice,
   but option 3 has produced the most reasonable results
   in test simulations. Repeating the analysis of Rahmati et. al. 2013 to
   directly parameterize HeI and HeII self-shielding behavior would be a valuable
   avenue of future research in developing a more complete self-shielding model.
   Each self-shielding option is described below.

     - 0: No self shielding. Elements are optically thin to the UV background.
     - 1: Not Recommended. Approximate self-shielding in HI only. 
          HeI and HeII are left as optically thin.
     - 2: Approximate self-shielding in both HI and HeI. HeII remains
          optically thin.
     - 3: Approximate self-shielding in both HI and HeI, but ignoring
          HeII ionization and heating from the UV background entirely
          (HeII ionization and heating rates are set to zero). 

   These methods only work in conjunction with using updated Cloudy
   cooling tables, denoted with "_shielding". These tables properly account
   for the decrease in metal line cooling rates in self-shielded regions,
   which can be significant. 

   For consistency, when ``primordial_chemistry > 2``, the self-shielding
   attenutation factors calculated for HI and HeI are applied to the 
   H\ :sub:`2`\ ionization (15.4 eV) and H\ :sub:`2`\ :sup:`+` dissociation
   rates (30 eV) respectively. These reaction rates are distinct from the
   H\ :sub:`2`\ self-shielding computed using the ``H2_self_shielding``
   flag.

.. c:var:: int h2_charge_exchange_rate

   Flag which selects the formula used for calculating the ``k11`` rate 
   coefficient. Default: 1.

      - 1: Equation 4 from `Savin et. al., 2004 <https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0404288>`_.
      - 2: Table 3, Equation 11 from `Abel et. al., 1996 <https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9608040>`_.

.. c:var:: int h2_dust_rate

   Flag which selects the formula used for calculating the ``h2dust`` rate
   coefficient. Default: 1.

      - 1: Table 1, Equation 23 from `Omukai, 2000 <https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0003212>`_.
      - 2: Equation 3.8 from `Hollenbach & McKee, 1979 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979ApJS...41..555H/abstract>`_.

.. c:var:: int h2_h_cooling_rate

   Flag which selects the formula for calculating the ``GAHI`` rate coefficient.
   Default: 1.

      - 1: Equation based on `Lique, 2015 <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/453/1/810/1752438>`_. 
      - 2: Equation 40 with fitting coefficients found in Table 8, from `Glover & Abel, 2008 <https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1768>`_.

   Notes on setting 1:
      This fit is accurate to within ~5% over the temperature range 100 < T < 5000 K. Lique (2015)
      doesn't present data above 5000 K, so at higher temperatures the rate has been calculated
      assuming that the de-excitation rate coefficients have the same values that they have at 5000 K.
      Lique also doesn't give rates for T < 100 K, but since we don't expect H2 cooling to be important
      there, it should be OK to just set the rate to zero.

.. c:var:: int collisional_excitation_rates

   On/off flag to toggle calculation of rate coefficients corresponding to collisional excitations 
   (``ceHI``, ``ceHeI`` and ``ceHeII``). Default: 1

.. c:var:: int collisional_ionisation_rates

   On/off flag to toggle calculation of rate coefficients corresponding to collisional ionisations 
   (``ciHeIS``, ``ciHI``, ``ciHeI`` and ``ciHeII``). Default: 1

.. c:var:: int recombination_cooling_rates

   On/off flag to toggle calculation of rate coefficients corresponding to recombination cooling 
   (``reHII``, ``reHeII1``, ``reHeII2`` and ``reHeIII``). Default: 1

.. c:var:: int bremsstrahlung_cooling_rates

   On/off flag to toggle calculation of rate coefficients corresponding to bremsstrahlung cooling 
   (``brem``). Default: 1

.. c:var:: int max_iterations

   The maximum subcycle iterations allowed when evolving the chemistry
   network and internal energy in :c:func:`solve_chemistry`. The
   default of 10000 should be sufficient in most situations. However,
   certain physical conditions, such as dense gas that has been
   photo-ionized, can lead to extremely short timesteps. In cases like
   this, increasing the iteration limit by a factor of 10 or more is
   enough to work through difficult conditions. For other situations
   which are currently not well understood, this will not help. If you
   encounter a situation where the iteration limit continues to be
   exceeded for extremely high values, please report it. The behavior
   of the code when the iteration limit is exceeded is controled by
   the :c:data:`exit_after_iterations_exceeded` parameter. Default:
   10000.

.. c:var:: int exit_after_iterations_exceeded

   Flag controlling the behavior when the maximum subcycle iterations
   (set by :c:data:`max_iterations`) is exceeded in
   :c:func:`solve_chemistry`. If set to 1, an error message will be
   printed and the function will immediately exit with a return value
   of 0, indicating failure. If set to 0, the message will be
   produced and there will be no further integration, but the function
   will proceed to a clean exit such that the simulation can be
   continued. Default: 0.

.. c:var:: int omp_nthreads

   Sets the number of OpenMP threads.  If not set, this will be set to
   the maximum number of threads possible, as determined by the system
   or as configured by setting the ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` environment
   variable.  Note, Grackle must be compiled with OpenMP support
   enabled.  See :ref:`openmp`.

Data Files
----------

All data files are located in the **input** directory in the source.

The first three files contain the heating and cooling rates for both
primordial and metal species as well as the UV background photo-heating
and photo-ionization rates.  For all three files, the valid density and
temperature range is given below.  Extrapolation is performed when
outside of the data range.  The metal cooling rates are stored for
solar metallicity and scaled linearly with the metallicity of the gas.

Valid range:

 - number density: -10 < log\ :sub:`10` (n\ :sub:`H` / cm\ :sup:`-3`) < 4

 - temperature: the temperature range is 1 < log\ :sub:`10` (T / K) < 9.

Data files:

 - **CloudyData_noUVB.h5** - cooling rates for collisional ionization
   equilibrium.

 - **CloudyData_UVB=FG2011.h5** - heating and cooling rates and UV
   background rates from the work of `Faucher-Giguere et. al. (2009)
   <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...703.1416F>`_, updated in 2011.
   The maxmimum redshift is 10.6.  Above that, collisional ionization
   equilibrium is assumed.

 - **CloudyData_UVB=HM2012.h5** - heating and cooling rates and UV
   background rates from the work of `Haardt & Madau (2012)
   <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...746..125H>`_.  The maximum
   redshift is 15.13.  Above that, collisional ionization equilibrium is
   assumed.

 - **CloudyData_UVB=HM2012_high_density.h5** - same as
   **CloudyData_UVB=HM2012.h5** but goes to higher density (10\ :sup:`10`
   atom / cm\ :sup:`3`) and was computed with a more recent version of
   Cloudy (17.06).

To use the self-shielding approximation (see ``self_shielding_method``),
one must properly account for the change in metal line cooling rates in
self-shielded regions. Using the optically thin tables described above can
result in an order of magnitude overestimation in the net cooling rate at
certain densities. We have re-computed these tables by constructing
Jeans-length depth models in Cloudy at each density - temperature pair, 
tabulating the cooling and heating rates from the core of each of these
clouds. These models enforce a maximum depth of 100 pc.
In addition, these tables contain the spectrum averaged absorption
cross sections needed for the Rahmati et. al. 2013 self-shielding 
approximations. Currently only the HM2012 table has been recomputed. 

.. note::
   The cooling rates in the files below are known to have unphysically
   high heating rates at low densities (see `Issue #7
   <https://github.com/grackle-project/grackle_data_files/issues/7>`__
   of `grackle_data_files
   <https://github.com/grackle-project/grackle_data_files>`__). In
   practice, this is primarily an issue when running with
   :c:data:`primordial_chemistry` set to 0 (i.e., fully tabulated
   cooling mode). While this issue also affects the metal cooling
   rates, this component is negligible in the densities and
   temperatures where this happens. As such, these can be used with
   :c:data:`primordial_chemistry` >= 1 and
   :c:data:`self_shielding_method` enabled. **It is not recommended to
   use these files with primordial_chemistry set to 0.**

 - **CloudyData_UVB=HM2012_shielded.h5** - updated heating and cooling
   rates with the HM2012 UV background, accounting for self-shielding.

 - **CloudyData_UVB=FG2011_shielded.h5** - updated heating and cooling
   rates with the FG2011 UV background, accounting for self-shielding.

The final file includes only metal cooling rates under collisional
ionization equilibrium, i.e., no incident radiation field.  This table
extends to higher densities and also varies in metallicity rather than
scaling proportional to the solar value.  This captures the
thermalization of metal coolants occuring at high densities, making this
table more appropriate for simulations of collapsing gas-clouds.

Valid range:

 - number density: -6 < log\ :sub:`10` (n\ :sub:`H` / cm\ :sup:`-3`) < 12

 - metallicity: -6 < log\ :sub:`10` (Z / Z\ :sub:`sun`) < 1

 - temperature: the temperature range is 1 < log\ :sub:`10` (T / K) < 8.

Data file:

 - **cloudy_metals_2008_3D.h5** - collisional ionization equilibrium,
   metal cooling rates only.
