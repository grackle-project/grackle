Running the Test Suite
----------------------

Grackle contains a number of unit and answer tests to verify that
everything is working properly.

Unit tests (i.e., those with explicitly known correct answers) include
the following:

 - correct library versioning

 - correct behavior of the dynamic API

 - proper and comoving unit systems are consistent

 - mean molecular weight increases with metallicity

 - atomic, primordial collisional ionization equilibrium agrees with
   the analytical solution

 - all Python code conforms to `PEP 8
   <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__

Answer tests are those whose correct answers must be generated from a
prior, trusted version of Grackle (i.e., the "gold standard"). The
tests are first run using this trusted version to generate the
results, then run again on the latest version to compate. These tests
include:

 - all code examples build, run, and return correct results

 - all python examples run and give correct results for a range of
   parameter values

 - all grackle 'calculate' functions return correct results for sets
   of random field values

Tests Without Answer Verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you only want to quickly verify that everything runs, you can skip
generating the answer test results using the latest gold standard. To
run this way, first set the ``GENERATE_PYGRACKLE_TEST_RESULTS``
environment variable to 1.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   ~ $ export GENERATE_PYGRACKLE_TEST_RESULTS=1

This will tell the test suite to simply generate new answers and not
compare with previously existing ones.

Once you have installed :ref:`pygrackle and the development
dependencies <pygrackle-dev>`, the tests can be run from the **src**
directory by typing ``make test``:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   ~ $ cd grackle/src
   ~/grackle/src $ make test

or from the **src/python** directory by typing ``py.test``:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   ~ $ cd grackle/src/python
   ~/grackle/src $ py.test

Now it's time to :ref:`integrate grackle into your simulation code
<integration>`.

Tests With Answer Verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To include answer test verification, one must first generate the
answers from the last gold standard version of Grackle. Gold standards
are marked with annotated git tags and are named 'gold-standard-v' and
then a number, for example, 'gold-standard-v1'. To find the latest
gold standard, type ``git tag``. If nothing is output, you may need to
first fetch the tags from the main repo with something like ``git
fetch origin --tags`` (where 'origin' in this example is assumed to
point to the main Grackle repository on github.)

To generate test results from the latest gold standard, follow these
steps:

#. Navigate your Grackle repository to the gold standard commit with,
   for example, ``git checkout gold-standard-v1``.

#. Re-compile the Grackle library and :ref:`re-install pygrackle
   <install-pygrackle>`.

#. Set the ``GENERATE_PYGRACKLE_TEST_RESULTS`` environment variable to
   1.

#. Run the test suite as described above. This will create test result
   files in the directory **src/python/tests/test_answers**.

#. Return to the branch of the repository you started with. If you just
   cloned the main repository, this will be called 'main', in which
   case do ``git checkout main``.

#. Re-compile the Grackle library and :ref:`re-install pygrackle
   <install-pygrackle>`.

#. Set the ``GENERATE_PYGRACKLE_TEST_RESULTS`` environment variable to
   0.

#. Run the test suite again. This time, the answer tests will be
   compared with the previously generated results.
