# NOTE: scikit-build-core doesn't use the root-level CMakeLists.txt file,
#       instead we have it use src/python/CMakeLists.txt.
#
# There are 2 reasons for placing this at the root-level directory
# (rather than in src/python):
#   1. it ensures that the source-distribution of our source-directory and the
#      SDist we'll eventually distribute via PyPI will have the same structure
#   2. it ensures that gracklepy can be installable by invoking
#      pip install gracklepy @ git+https://github.com/grackle-project/grackle

{bold.red}Your build of gracklepy from a sdist failed.{normal} (You should
ignore the rest of this message if you were explicitly want to install from an
sdist).

For more context:

- The sdist and wheel formats are the 2 modern standardized formats for python
  package distribution. At a high-level, both of them handle a package's python
  code in a similar manner. The largest differences occurs when packages (like
  grackle) have extension modules, written in compiled languages (like C).
  1. A sdist (source-distribution) includes the extension modules' source code.
     When installing an sdist, your package manager (e.g. pip) directly compiles
     the extension module & links it against dependencies, as part of process.
  2. A wheel ships a precompiled copy of extension module (& copies of external
     dependencies). During installation, your package manager copies the
     precompiled extension module & any dependencies to the installation

- Since your package manager tried to install gracklepy from a sdist, that
  probably means that a wheel isn't available for your current python version
  on the {platform.platform} (with the {platform.machine}). If this is a common
  Unix platform, please let the us (the Grackle developers know) and we can
  consider adding wheels for this platform in the future.

- Your build probably failed because you are missing a compiler, your compiler
  is too old, you are missing a dependency (e.g. hdf5), or the build-system
  can't automatically infer some of this info.

- We recommend installing gracklepy directly from the git repository. We provide
  detailed instructions on our website (https://grackle.readthedocs.io). If you
  encounter further problems, please reach out.
