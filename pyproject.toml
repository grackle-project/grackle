# NOTE: scikit-build-core doesn't use the root-level CMakeLists.txt file,
#       instead we have it use src/python/CMakeLists.txt.
#
# There are 2 reasons for placing this at the root-level directory
# (rather than in src/python):
#   1. it ensures that the source-distribution of our source-directory and the
#      SDist we'll eventually distribute via PyPI will have the same structure
#   2. it ensures that pygrackle can be installable by invoking
#      pip install pygrackle @ git+https://github.com/grackle-project/grackle
