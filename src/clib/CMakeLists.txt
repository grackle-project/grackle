#    auto-generated files for consistency
# -> in modern Grackle revisions, classic-build put these files in better spots

# A downstream application built with CMake generally has 2 inclusion
# approaches (ways that they can make use of this build):
#    1. they can build Grackle as part of the downstream build.
#       - in this case, the downstream build calls add_subdirectory on the top
#         level directory of Grackle and they can access the targets defined in
#         this file.
#    2. they can use the installed library
#       - in this case, the downstream build will get access to the targets
#         defined in a special CMake export-file created during installation
#
# We take some care to make these approaches as interchangable as possible for
# downstream build. To that end, we take 2 primary steps:
#
# - we name the main target Grackle_Grackle, rather than just [Gg]rackle to
#   minimize the chance for name-collisions of targets created by the build of
#   the downstream application (this is relevant for approach #1)
#

#   convention... (they are more useful if we built multiple targets as part of
