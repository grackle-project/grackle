This subdirectory defines data structures (and routines for initializing the data structures) that pertain to the injection models.

At the time of writing, the injection model is used by any Grackle configuration using metal chemistry.

After we address GH Issue #446, the injection model will **ONLY** be used with the multigrain species dust model. At that point, we should move the contents of this directory into the dust subdirectory.
