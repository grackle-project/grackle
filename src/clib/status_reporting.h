/// @file status_reporting.h
/// @brief Declares the tools used for result-reporting
///
/// Purpose
/// =======
/// Define machinery to let us standardize our internal logic for
/// status-reporting. This will:
/// - reduce boilerplate code
/// - allow us to provide more context (e.g. filename/lineno/function name)
/// - allow us to more easily change how we communicate this information with
///   the downstream application in the future (if we decide that is something
///   we ultimately want to do -- we motivate this in the next section)
///
/// Current Status
/// ==============
/// In general, status-reporting is an area where Grackle could really improve.
/// At the time of writing, our error/status reporting leaves a lot to be
/// desired. Essentially, it consists of:
/// - returning a binary code GR_SUCCESS or GR_FAIL
/// - printing some extra output information:
///   - we use fprintf(stderr, ...) in the C routines when errors arise
///   - we print some context information in the Fortran
///
/// Ideally, we would adopt a solution that provides the downstream application
/// (i.e. the simulation-code or Gracklepy) control over whether/how this info
/// is consumed/recorded.
///
/// Motivating Perspective
/// ======================
/// Must of us are developers of simulation-codes, but status reporting in the
/// context of a library is different. In particular, considerations for a
/// numerical library are very different from other libraries.
///
/// For this discussion, we ignore warnings.
///
/// The statuses that we communicate primarily fall under 2: (i) unrecoverable
/// internal errors and (ii) function results.
///
/// It is also important to realize that there are certain errors we just can't
/// check without crippling Grackle's performance. Documentation needs to be
/// exceptionally clear in these cases.
///
/// I. Unrecoverable Internal Errors
/// --------------------------------
/// The idea is that if Grackle detects that it is a state where it seems like
/// it may produce bad/unreliable results/behavior, we print an error message
/// and immediately abort the program.
///
/// Generally, this is the result of a sanity check or a broken invariant.
///
/// As a rule of thumb:
/// - if the sanity check is a direct result of the application's action, we
///   should prefer to gracefully communicate this to the application
/// - always consider, should this error crash an interactive Jupyter session
///   using Gracklepy?
/// - loudly failing is ALWAYS better than silently failing. Since these errors
///   are quick and easy to add, these can be a quick temporary solution to
///   address a problematic code path (and an indication that we need to more
///   gracefully handle the error mode in the future)
///
/// Function Results
/// ----------------
/// There are generally 4 kinds of results/statuses a grackle-like library
/// might want to report. 2 are currently relevant. 2 more may become relevant
/// in the future. These result/statuses may include
/// - the API function successfully completed an operation
/// - (may become relevant with GPUs) a function, which can be configured to be
///   either synchronous or asynchronous (@ compile-time or runtime), wants to
///   report that it is being invoked in an "asynchronous mode" and that it
///   succesfully launched a GPU kernel. The premise is that the function would
///   report the successful-completion status if the function had been
///   configured in its "synchronous mode," and the whole operation had been a
///   success. (Honestly, we may choose to simply denote success in both cases)
/// - (may become relevant with GPUs) a temporary error occurred that could be
///   overcome by trying again. For example, a GPU had too much pending work
///   (honestly, we may want to configure Grackle so it knows to try again).
/// - A generic error occurred that requires human-intervention
///
/// It is useful to highlight categories of these generic errors (the last of
/// the above kinds). There is some overlap here. Categories may include:
/// 1. resource errors like out-of-memory. While we can't really deal with OOM
///    errors on CPUs (due to "memory overcommitment") it may be worth
///    supporting on GPUs.
/// 2. invalid parameter values
///    - depending on the application and parameter this may result from
///      end-user or application
///    - there's a lot of value to providing lots of info about these errors
///      (to make debugging much more pleasant)
/// 3. file-system errors when reading the datafile. This could happen if the
///    specified path isn't valid (e.g. it doesn't point to a valid hdf5 file,
///    there is a permissions issue, etc.). Or it could happen do to a system
///    error (a network filesystem is down or too many files are open)
/// 4. An obviously invalid argument is detected (e.g. passing a nullptr). This
///    is clearly an application error.
/// 5. A broken precondition indicating that the application has made an error
///    using the API
/// 6. Generic calculation error (e.g. exceeding the iteration limit or
///    detecting a NaN). This could arise because the application provided
///    nonsensical field values. It could also arise simply because the current
///    logic doesn't handle a particular case very well. An application might
///    want to know about this class of errors so that it could log extra
///    information (e.g. the current simulation cycle and location) so that the
///    error can be reproduced later.
///
/// Hypothetically, it could also be cool to allow more recoverable
/// error-handling when a calculation error only affects a small subset of
/// field values (e.g. the code might overwrite those zones with values from
/// neighboring cells). From a practical perspective, this may not be a good
/// use of time.
///
/// How this can be improved
/// ========================
/// An issue will be created that describes various strategies for improved
/// reporting. A common strategy for dealing with simple errors involves exit
/// codes...
