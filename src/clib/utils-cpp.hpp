/// @macro GRIMPL_FORCE_INLINE
/// @brief replacement for ``inline`` that forces inlining (on some compilers)
///
/// This macro should be used sparingly (if you force inlining of too much, you
/// will slow down the code. On unsupported macros, this just becomes the
/// ``inline`` keyword
///
/// While the initial purpose of ``inline`` keyword was to encourage optimizers
/// to inline annotated functions, they are free to ignore this hint.
/// - In C++, the ``inline`` keyword has come to mean that a single function
///   can be defined in separate translation units (the definitions must be the
///   same unless it is also a ``static`` function).
///   - This behavior is what allows you to put the definition of an ordinary,
///     ``inline`` function in a header and safely include that file in
///     multiple source files (function template behave kinda like an
///     ``inline`` function, even without the keyword).
///   - Unless you are using link-time-optimization, you **need** to follow
///     this pattern for defining a given function if you want to the optimizer
///     to be able to inline calls to that function in multiple source files.
///     (But, the optimizer is still not to inline).
/// - Be aware, the semantics of the ``inline`` keyword are slightly different
///   in C (C actually adopted the keyword from C++).
///   - The easiest way to achieve roughly the same behavior as C++ (with
///     putting the definitions of ``inline`` functions in headers that are
///     included in multiple source files) is to make the function
///     ``static inline``
///   - in C, ``inline`` functions, that aren't ``static inline``, also have
///     special rules/restrictions about using ``static`` local variables
///     inside of the definition.

/// @macro GRIMPL_RESTRICT
/// @brief Equivalent to C99's ``restrict`` qualifier (on supported compilers)
///
/// Background
/// ----------
/// Fortran's reputation for producing faster numerical code involving arrays
/// than C/C++ comes from the fact that Fortran forbids (by default) overlap
/// in the memory regions for arrays that are represented by distinct
/// variables. that use to store array elements. A C/C++ compiler typically
/// must be much more conservative about optimizations because pointers are
/// allowed to freely overlap.
/// - consider a function that performs loops over pairs of elements in arrays
///   tracked by pointers ``a`` and ``b`` and write the result to an array
///   tracked by pointer ``c``.
/// - Outside of special cases, the compiler commonly has to assume that the
///   memory locations accessed through pointer ``c`` may overlap with the
///   elements accessed through ``a`` or ``b``. In that case, the precise order
///   of the loop evaluation (and the timing of when values are accessed from 
///   ``a`` or ``b`` or are written to ``c``) matters.
/// - This significantly inhibits auto-vectorization.
/// - (There is also overhead with pointers in general)
///
/// C99's ``restrict`` qualifier
/// ----------------------------
/// To facillitate faster code, the C99 standard introduced the ``restrict``
/// qualifier that can be attached to a pointer to object-type (e.g. a pointer
/// to an ``int`` or ``float``)
/// - When developers add this qualifier to a pointer, ``ptr``, they are making
///   making a promise to the compiler for a given scope. They essentially
///   promise that if an object accessible through ``ptr`` is modified in that
///   scope, all access/modifications to that object are performed with ``ptr``
/// - This facillitates Fortran-like optimizations (the compiler can also
///   choose to ignore the information)
/// - Obviously, violating this promise can obviously produces all manner of
///   undefined behavior.
///
/// C++ does **NOT** provide a ``restrict`` qualifier, but many compilers
/// support it as an extension (usually called ``__restrict__``). This macro is
/// intended to expand to ``__restrict__`` where applicable)
///
/// > [!note]
/// > The ``restrict`` qualifier is a lesser known and lesser used feature of
/// > C. Consequently, machinery in backends of C/C++ compilers that use this
/// > information to make optimization may not be rigorously tested unless they
/// > are also used as backends for other languages that more regularly perform
/// > this kind of optimization.
/// > - gcc's backend is probably pretty robust since it is also used by
/// >   gfortran
/// > - in contrast, bugs were found (they've been fixed) over the last several
/// >   years in LLVM (clang's backend) by developers of the Rust lanugague.
/// >
/// > With that in mind, we currently just use this macro as a placeholder that
/// > we can always try later.
/// > - I think it's useful to use this in transcribed code so that we properly
/// >   retain as much contextual information as possible (it's easy to remove
/// >   later!). The Fortran code is written in such a way that we can apply
/// >   this very liberally.
/// > - To be clear, I have a lot more faith in enabling this feature than
/// >   passing the ``-ffast-math`` flag to gcc (__restrict__ semantics are
/// >   well defined and its opt-in)

///
/// Overview
/// --------
/// This file holds the declaration/definition of the grackle::Imple::View
/// class template. You should think of instances of the class template as a
/// special kind of pointer:
///  - instances can be empty (i.e. they encode a nullptr) or store the address
///    to memory that is used to store a multidimensional array
///  - instances also track the shape of the multidimensional array in order 
///    to support. For example, an to access the value stored at index 
///    ``i``, ``j``, ``k`` in data represented by an instance ``view`` using
///    ``view(i,j,k)`` where ``i`` is the index along the fast access (we could
///    add support for customizing data layout in the future if we deem it
///    useful)
///  - it has pointer semantics (more on this below)
///
/// The idea of a ``View`` is common in various C++ HPC libraries (e.g. see
/// Kokkos or Raja). Enzo-E makes use of a similar ``CelloView``. In modern C++
/// lingo this is a kind of span. If we were using C++23, we might use
/// std::mdspan instead of defining a custom type.
///
/// Motivation
/// ----------
/// This class template primarily exists to ease the process of transcribing
/// fortran logic multidimensional arrays.
///
/// More detailed description
/// -------------------------
/// It is important to understand that this has all of the semantics of a
/// pointer and not the "value semantics" of a container implemented by
/// C++'s standard library.
///
/// Let's consider a few key scenarios:
/// 1. Const-semantics:
///    - When you have a View of ``const`` values, ``View<const int*>``, you
///      can't modify the values, similar to ``const int*``. There is no
///      container equivalent (e.g. ``std::vector<const int>`` doesn't exist)
///    - Like a variable holding a ``const`` pointer to an integer,
///      ``int const *``, a variable holding a ``const View<int*>`` can be used
///      to freely modify referenced values. In both cases ``const`` means that
///      the properties of the array (shape/memory-address) can't change. (In
///      contrast, you can't mutate elements of a ``const std::vector<int>``)
/// 2. Copying/assignment:
///    - Like with copying a pointer, copying a View just copies the properites
///      of the underlying data (shape/memory-address). If you store a copy of
///      ``view_a`` and store it in a variable ``view_b``, then ``view_a`` and
///      ``view_b`` can be used to access/modify data at the same memory
///      location. If ``view_b`` previously held information about a different
///      view, the act of copying has no impact on the values in the old view.
///      (Both behaviors contrast with ``std::vector`` where copy operations
///      always involve making a deepcopy).
///
/// At this time, a View can not allocate its own data. For example of how to
/// do this, see Enzo-E's CelloView class template.
///
/// Considerations
/// --------------
/// In the long-term, it may make sense to use a ``View`` template class that
/// wraps Kokkos::View. It is a relatively elegant way to attach information
/// about where memory is allocated.
/// - We might want to remove all use of this as a 2D View
/// - We might also want to remove all use of this as a 3D View and just use it
///   as a 1D View (it depends on our thoughts about self-shielding)
