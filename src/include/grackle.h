/// unstable/experimental machinery
/// ===============================
/// entities defined down below (prefixed with `grunstable_`) are experimental
/// features that are not yet part of the public API. We reserve the right to
/// change, modify, remove these features at ANY time (we may provide more
/// details on a function by function basis)

/// @defgroup Experimental API for dynamically Accessing Rates
///
/// This group of entities defines the experimental API for accessing rates in
/// a manner that is API/ABI stable without needing to access implementation
/// details (i.e. the internals if `chemistry_data_storage`).
///
/// In the longer term it would be REALLY nice to support a truly dynamic set
/// of rates (i.e. the collection of allowed rates need not be known at
/// compile-time). If this is a serious goal, it may be nice if this API is
/// general enough so that it doesn't need to change in that transition.
///
/// > [!note]
/// > The API currently uses a handle called rateid. You lookup the handle
/// > from a string and then use the handle to lookup various properties.
/// > Currently, we just support looking up the array, but we could add
/// > functions to query other properties like shape or rate-type (i.e. is it
/// > a cooling rate or rxn rate).
/// > - while this may seem like overkill, this is a lesson learned from a
/// >   implementing dynamic api for parameters. Mapping a string to a value
/// >   (or entity) without any mutable dynamic memory allocation in a
/// >   simple, portable-threadsafe manner (without undefined behavior),
/// >   requires a `O(N)` linear search. (Using the API to iterate
/// >   over all rates has `O(N^2)` complexity)
/// > - but, if we're willing to allocate a dict/map when initializing Grackle,
/// >   then I would be happy to get rid of rateid (we'd need to do this
/// >   anyways to support any variant of this API for dynamic rates)
///
/// > [!note]
/// > There are a number of considerations before stablization. Some are
/// > discussed in docstrings. Below we summarize more generic considerations:
/// > 1. Do we want to be able to use this API to eventually support a dynamic
/// >    set of rates? If so, then:
/// >    - we are free to get rid of the rateid handle (there are still some
/// >      reasons to retain it, but we need to decide whether simplicity is
/// >      better)
/// >    - we should probably update all of the function signatures so that a
/// >      pointer to chemistry_data_storage* is passed as an argument to each
/// >      of the functions.
/// > 2. Should we prevent direct access to the underlying data pointers?
/// >    Instead we would provide getter and setters. We discuss this further
/// >    down below (in the relevant function's API). This is important for
/// >    different backends.
/// > 3. We should generally consider whether the API is consistent enough with
/// >    APIs for accessing other data structures.
/// >    - currently the dynamic parameter API is grackle's only other
/// >      data-access API, but we could imagine creating an API for the fields
/// >      (in order to achieve ABI stability)

/// > 1. When we add GPU support, the rate data may live permanently on the GPU
/// >    (or some data may live on the GPU while other data lives on the CPU).
/// >    With dedicated setters/getters, we could always require that the
/// >    provided buffer data is on the CPU.
/// > 2. We have the option to conditionally disable the setter. For example,
/// >    if we choose to support custom rates, I assume we will want to specify
/// >    all custom choices as part of initialization (for simplicity) and then
/// >    we may want to deprecate/remove the setter. (One could also imagine,
/// >    disabling the setter when using GPUs).
/// > 3. It eliminates a certain class of memory-lifetime bugs (People could
/// >    try use the pointer returned by the incarnation of this function after
/// >    destroying Grackle. This problem can't happen with the proposed
/// >    getter/setter)
